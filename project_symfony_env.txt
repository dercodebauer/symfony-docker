Container environment for Symfony 5:

Requirements for Symfony 5:
- PHP 7.2.5
- php ext:  Ctype, iconv, JSON, PCRE, Session, SimpleXML, and Tokenizer
- composer
- mysql
- nginx


Working with the Containers:

docker-compose up -d
--> runs (and builds if not already built) the containers according to the images (blue prints) described in the docker files

docker-compose up -d --build
--> rebuilds containers (use if you have changed docker-compose.yml or one of the docker files) 

docker ps
--> list the running docker containers

docker-compose stop
--> stop running docker containers

docker rm <name_of_docker_container>
--> remove docker container (find name with docker ps)

docker exec -it <name_of_docker_container> bash
--> get access to bash in a docker container (use "exit" to leave the container)

- To run PHPUnit, Composer or any Symfony Cmd use the bash in the "app" container
- To get console access to mysql databases use the bash in the "database" container as you would on your local system: mysql -umysql_user -ppasswd (you can find and change the credentials in the docker-compose file)
 

See frontend of project:

Port 8080 of the docker interface is mapped to port 80 of the "web" container where nginx is running. Go to localhost:8080 to use the frontend of yout project.


Use PHPMyAdmin:

Port 8090 of the docker interface is mapped to port 80 of the "phpmyadmin" container. Go to localhost:8090 to use PHPMyAdmin to manage the databases of the "database" container.


Use XDEBUG with Docker and PHPStorm:
